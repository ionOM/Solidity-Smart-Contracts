This smart contract is a voting contract that allows users to create candidates, vote for candidates, and keep track of voter and candidate information. It uses the OpenZeppelin Counters contract for keeping track of voter and candidate IDs. The contract has several important features, including:

* A votingOrganizer variable that stores the address of the contract creator (set in the constructor).
* A setNewOrganizer function that allows the current voting organizer to change the address stored in the votingOrganizer variable.
* A setCandidate function that allows the voting organizer to add candidates to the contract. This function increments the candidate ID counter, assigns the current value of the counter to the candidate's ID, sets the candidate's vote count to 0, and adds the candidate's address to the candidateAddress array.
* A voters mapping that stores all voter information, including their ID, address, whether they are allowed to vote, whether they have voted, and their vote (if they have voted).
* A candidates mapping that stores all candidate information, including their ID, vote count, and address.
startTime and endTime variables that store the start and end time of the voting period.
* A VoterCreated event that is emitted when a voter is created, and a CandidateCreate event that is emitted when a candidate is created.
* A votedVoters array that stores the addresses of all voters who have voted.
* A votersAddress array that stores the addresses of all the voters.
* 
The contract also has several require statements to ensure that only the voting organizer can add candidates, and that only the voting organizer or the original creator can change the voting organizer address.
