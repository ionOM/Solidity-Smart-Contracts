This is a lottery solidity smart contract. The contract defines several variables, such as "owner", "players", "entryCost", "deadline" and "currentAmount" that are used to keep track of the important state of the lottery.

The "owner" variable is an Ethereum address that represents the owner of the contract. Only the owner of the contract can perform certain actions, such as choosing the winner and restarting the lottery.

The "players" variable is an array of Ethereum addresses that stores the addresses of the users who have entered the lottery. When a user enters the lottery by calling the "enter()" function, their address is added to this array.

The "entryCost" variable is a uint (unsigned integer) variable that stores the cost in Wei (the smallest unit of Ether) that is required to enter the lottery. This cost is set in the contract's constructor function.

The "deadline" variable is a uint that stores the timestamp of when the lottery will end. This is also set in the contract's constructor function.

The "currentAmount" variable is a uint that stores the total amount of Ether that has been sent to the contract by all users who have entered the lottery.

The contract also define an Event AllTimeWinners, which will emit the winner of the lottery every time the pickWinner function is called.

The contract has several functions that allow users to interact with the lottery, such as "enter()", "pickWinner()", "changeCost()", "isEnded()", "totalPlayers()", and "restartLottery()".

The "enter()" function allows users to enter the lottery by sending the required amount of Ether to the contract. The function checks if the user has sent enough Ether to cover the entry cost, and if the deadline for entering the lottery has not passed yet. If these conditions are met, the user's address is added to the "players" array, and their sent ether amount is added to the "currentAmount" variable.

The "pickWinner()" function is used by the contract's owner to choose the winner of the lottery. This function can only be called after the deadline has passed. The function chooses the winner randomly by using the keccak256 hashing function and modulo operation. The winner's address is then sent the balance of the contract.

The "changeCost()" function allows the contract's owner to change the entry cost for the lottery. This function can only be called after the deadline has passed.

The "isEnded()" function returns a boolean value indicating whether the lottery has ended or not.

The "totalPlayers()" function returns the total number of players that have entered the lottery.

The "restartLottery()" function allows the contract's owner to restart the lottery after the previous one has ended. The function takes one argument "durationInDays" which is the duration of the new lottery in days.

The contract also has two additional functions "receive()" and "fallback()" which are used to receive ether, these functions allow the contract to receive incoming transactions, particularly useful when someone sends ether to the contract without specifying any function.
